Starting and Stopping the Generator Set

4.3.1

Pre-start Checks
WARNING
EXHAUST GAS IS DEADLY!
Exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas. Carbon monoxide is
poisonous and can cause unconsciousness and death. Symptoms of carbon monoxide
poisoning include:
â¢ Dizziness
â¢ Muscular twitching
â¢ Weakness and sleepiness
â¢ Throbbing in temples
â¢ Headache
â¢ Inability to think clearly
â¢ Nausea
â¢ Vomiting
IF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCES ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, GET OUT INTO THE
FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention. Shut down the generator
set and do not operate it until it has been inspected and repaired.
Never occupy the vehicle with the generator set running unless the vehicle is equipped with a
working carbon monoxide detector. However, primary protection against inhaling carbon
monoxide is proper installation of the exhaust system, and daily (every 8 hours) inspection for
visible and audible exhaust system leaks.
Perform pre-start checks before the first start of the day and after every 8 hours of operation. See
Chapter 5 on page 29 if the vehicle has been in storage.
1. Make sure all vehicle CO detectors are working properly.
2. Remove access cover.
3. Inspect the generator set as instructed in Chapter 5 on page 29.
4. Perform any maintenance due (Section 5.1 on page 29).
5. Keep a maintenance log (Chapter 7).
6. Check for signs of fuel and exhaust leaks and for damage to the exhaust system.
7. Replace access cover.
8. Turn off the air conditioner and other large appliances.

4.3.2

Priming the Fuel System
The fuel system should be primed after the fuel filter is replaced or after the generator set runs out of fuel.
Position the control switch to STOP/PRIME for 30 seconds. The status indicator stays on while the pump
is on.

Starting the Generator Set
1. Visually inspect for fuel and exhaust leaks. Do not start the generator set until any fuel or exhaust
leak is repaired.
2. Position and hold the control switch to START until the generator set starts. The status indicator on
the switch flashes while cranking. It will stay on continuously when the generator set is running.
3. If the generator set fails to start, cranking will stop in approximately 30 seconds. The status indicator
will blink, indicating an over crank fault. Wait 5 seconds for the control to reset before trying again.
After 5 tries, let the starter motor cool down for 30 seconds before trying again. See Chapter 6 on
page 47 if the generator set does not start after several tries.

CAUTION
The starter motor can be damaged by overheating. Allow it to cool down for 30 seconds
after every fifth crank.
4. For top performance and engine life, especially in colder weather, let the engine warm up for 2
minutes before connecting appliances.
5. See Chapter 6 on page 47 if the generator set shuts down and the status indicator blinks, indicating
a fault.

4.3.4

Stopping the Generator Set
1. Turn off the air conditioner and other large appliances.
2. Run generator set for 2 minutes to allow for cool down.
3. Press the control switch in its STOP position.

4.4

Loading the Generator Set
The power rating (kW) on the generator set nameplate determines how much electrical load (motors, fans,
heaters, air conditioners, and other appliances) the generator set can power. If the sum of the loads
exceeds the generator set power rating, the generator set will shut down or its line circuit breakers will trip.

NOTICE
It may be necessary to run fewer appliances at the same timeâthe sum of the loads must not be
greater than the generator set power rating.
To avoid shutdowns due to generator set overload, use the electrical ratings on the nameplates of
equipment (if available) to compare the sum of the electrical loads that are likely to be used at the same
time to the generator set power rating. Refer to the table below for typical appliance ratings.
Appliance load and generator set power are measured in terms of Watts (W) or kilowatts (kW), where 1
kilowatt (kW) = 1000 Watts (W).
â¢ If the equipment is marked in Amps and Volts only, multiply the Amps times the Volts to obtain the
load in Watts.
â¢ Divide Watts by 1000 to obtain load in terms of kilowatts.
It is possible that the generator set circuit breaker may trip even though the sum of the steady state loads
is less than the generator set power rating. When a large motor or air conditioner is started last or cycles
off and on, the startup load is larger than its normal running load, causing the load to temporarily exceed
the generator set power rating.

4. Operation
Typical "invisible" charging loads:
â¢ During startup, air conditioners need "reserve" power and can draw 3â4 times the typical 1400â2400
Watts needed to run. Too much baseload can prevent air conditioners from starting.
â¢ Battery chargers are activated automatically and can draw a large load (up to 3000 Watts). Manage
electrical loads by adjusting battery charge rates to best suit your needs. Consult your
inverter/charger manual or manufacturer.

Battery chargers can be a source of significant load and will be on whether they are connected to shore power or
the generator set.

4.4.1

Power Versus Altitude
The generator set is rated at standard barometric pressure, humidity, and air temperature (reference ISO
3046). Low barometric pressure (high altitude) or high ambient temperature decreases engine power.
â¢ As ambient temperature increases, rated generator set engine power decreases approximately 1%
for every 5.5 Â°C (10 Â°F) above 25 Â°C (77 Â°F).
â¢ Power decreases approximately 3.5% of rated power each 305 m (1000 ft) of increase in elevation.
Refer to the table below for typical elevation/generator set power calculations.

NOTICE
It may be necessary to run fewer appliances at higher altitudes and ambient temperatures.

4.5

Exercising the Generator Set
Exercise the generator set at least 2 hours each month if use is infrequent. Run the generator set at
approximately 1/2 rated power. A single 2-hour exercise period is better than several shorter periods.
Exercising a generator set drives off moisture, relubricates the engine, replaces stale fuel in fuel lines, and
removes oxides from electrical contacts and generator slip rings. The result is better starting, longer
engine life, and greater reliability.

4. Operation

Resetting Line Circuit Breakers
If a generator set line circuit breaker or a circuit breaker in the power distribution panel trips, either a short
circuit has occurred or too many loads were connected.

NOTICE
The generator set continues to run if its circuit breaker trips.
If a circuit breaker trips:
1. Disconnect or turn off as many electrical loads as possible.
2. Reset the circuit breaker.
3. If the circuit breaker trips right away, either the appliance (or electrical load) has a short or the circuit
breaker is faulty. Call a qualified electrician.

NOTICE
It may be necessary to push the circuit breaker OFF to reset it and ON to reconnect the
circuit.
4. If the circuit breaker does not trip right away, reconnect loads one-by-one making sure not to
overload the generator set or cause a circuit breaker to trip. If a circuit breaker trips right away when
an appliance is connected, that appliance or circuit probably has a short.

FIGURE 5. CIRCUIT BREAKER CONNECTIONS

WARNING
Short circuits in electrical equipment can cause fire and electrical shock leading to severe
personal injury or death. Electrical equipment and its grounding must be maintained properly to
protect against short circuits.
Electrical equipment must be used and maintained properly, and be properly grounded, to cause the line
circuit breakers to trip when short circuits occur.
Electrical appliances and tools must be used and maintained in accordance with their manufacturer's
instructions and safety precautions. Proper grounding is needed to reduce the risk of electric shock and
fire.

Connecting Shore Power
WARNING
Interconnecting the generator set and shore power can lead to electrocution of utility line
workers, equipment damage, and fire. Use an approved switching device to prevent
interconnections.
A vehicle with provisions for connecting utility power must have an approved device to keep the generator
set and utility from being interconnected. See the generator set Installation Manual for more information.

4.8

Operating in Weather Extremes
Pay particular attention to the following items when operating the generator set in cold or hot weather.
1. Make sure nothing blocks airflow to and from the generator set.
2. Make sure engine oil viscosity is appropriate for the ambient temperature. See Section 5.5 on page
31 for engine oil recommendations.
3. Keep the generator set clean.
4. Perform maintenance due. See Section 5.1 on page 29.

4.9

Operating in Dusty Environments
Pay particular attention to the following items when operating the generator set in dusty environments.
1. Do not let dirt and debris accumulate inside the generator set compartment. Keep the generator set
clean.
2. Perform air filter element maintenance more often.
3. Change engine oil more often.

4.10

Care of New or Rebuilt Engine
Proper engine break-in on a new generator set or on one with a rebuilt engine is essential for top engine
performance and acceptable oil consumption. Run the generator set at approximately 1/2 rated power for
the first 2 hours and at 3/4 rated power for 2 more hours.
Proper engine oil and oil level are especially critical during break-in because of the higher engine
temperatures that can be expected. Change the oil if the oil is not appropriate for the ambient
temperatures during break-in. See Section 5.5 on page 31 for engine oil recommendations.
Check oil level twice a day or every 4 hours during the first 24 hours of operation and change the oil after
the first 50 hours of operation.

Engine Oil Recommendations
Use API (American Petroleum Institute) classified engine oils according to the following guidelines.
â¢ In emissions regulated areas, it is mandatory to use CF, CF-4, CG-4, CH-4, or CI-4 class oil with:
â¦ Low sulfur fuel - sulfur content less than 500 ppm (0.05% weight).
â¦ Ultra low sulfur fuel - sulfur content less than 15 ppm ( 0.0015% weight).
â¢ In non-emissions regulated areas, use high sulfur fuel.
â¦ If sulfur content is between 500 ppm (0.05% weight) and 5000 ppm (0.5% weight), CF class oil
is recommended.
â¦ If sulfur content is between 5000 ppm (0.5% weight) and 10,000 ppm (1.0% weight), use CF,
CF-4, CG-4, CH-4, or CI-4 class oil.

NOTICE
If high sulfur fuel is used, the oil and oil filter must be changed twice as often.
Look for the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) viscosity grade. Choose the viscosity grade
appropriate for the ambient temperatures expected until the next scheduled oil change. Multigrade oils
such as SAE 15W-40 are recommended for year round use.

Fuel Recommendations
WARNING
Diesel fuel is combustible and can cause severe personal injury or death. Do not smoke near fuel
tanks or fuel-burning equipment, or in areas sharing ventilation with such equipment. Keep
flames, sparks, pilot flames, electrical arcs and switches, and all other sources of ignition well
away. Keep a multi-class ABC fire extinguisher handy.
High quality diesel fuel is necessary for good performance and long engine life.
â¢ The specifications for the type and sulfur content (ppm and weight percentage) of the diesel fuel
used must comply with all emissions regulations applicable in the areas where the generator set is
to be operated.
â¢ Diesel fuels meeting ASTM D975 or EN 590 specifications are recommended. Use Grade 1-D diesel
fuel.
â¦ When the ambient temperature is below â10 oC (14 oF), a minimum Cetane number of 45 is
recommended.
â¦ When the ambient temperature is below â20 oC (â4 oF) or elevation is above 1500 m (5000 ft),
a minimum Cetane number of 50 is recommended.
â¢ Current US EPA regulations for non-road engines limit diesel fuel sulfur content to a maximum of
500 ppm (0.05% weight).
â¦ Use Grade 2-D S500 or 2-D S15 diesel fuel.
â¦ When the ambient temperature is below â10 oC (14 oF), use Grade 1-D S500 or 1-D S15 diesel
fuel.

NOTICE
Beginning in the year 2010, US EPA regulations limit diesel fuel sulfur content to a
maximum of 15 ppm (0.0015% weight).
â¢ Do not use diesel fuel with a sulfur content greater than 10,000 ppm (1.0% weight).
â¢ Diesel fuel must meet the ASTM D975 standard for lubricity and pass a minimum load level of 3100
grams as measured by ASTM D6078, or maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm as measured by
ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1.

5.6.2.1 Bio-diesel Fuels B5 â B20
B5 bio-diesel fuel that meets industry specifications and quality is suitable for use with this generator set.
Before using bio-diesel fuel blends above B5 and up to B20, the following conditions must be verified:

5. Maintenance

CAUTION
Market applications contain properties that can affect engine operating characteristics. It is
highly recommended that use of these bio-diesel fuel blends be avoided or exercised with extra
care. Use standard fuels in applications that experience seasonal usage, storage for periods
exceeding 90 days, and extreme temperatures or humidity.
The following bio-diesel fuel properties can affect engine performance:
â¢ Poor oxidation stability can accelerate fuel oxidation. Fuel oxidation reduces generator performance.
This effect is accelerated at increased ambient temperatures.
â¢ Properties change at temperatures below â5 oC (23 oF). Necessary precautions must be taken when
operating the generator with bio-diesel blends in low ambient temperatures.
â¦ Fuel heater
â¦ Hose insulation
â¦ Additional anti-gel fuel additives.
â¢ Bio-diesel fuel blends are an excellent medium for microbial growth. Microbes cause fuel system
corrosion and premature filter plugging. The effectiveness of all commercially available conventional
anti-microbial additives, when used in bio-diesel fuel, is not known. Consult your fuel and additive
supplier for assistance.
If bio-diesel fuel is used for seasonal applications (stored more than 90 days), the generator must be
purged before storage by running the engine on pure diesel fuel meeting ASTM D975 for a minimum of 30
minutes.

Troubleshooting

6.1

Overview
WARNING
Hot engine parts can cause severe burns. Always allow the engine to cool down before
performing any maintenance or service.
The following paragraphs provide fault code faults and symptom-based faults. If a problem is not resolved
after taking the corrective actions suggested, contact a local dealer or distributor. See Section 2.4 on
page 10.

NOTICE
Maintaining engine oil level, keeping battery connections clean and tight, watching the fuel
gauge, not overloading the generator set, etc. will prevent most shutdowns.

NOTICE
When the generator set and vehicle engine share a common fuel tank, the fuel dip tubes are
usually arranged so that the generator set will run out of fuel first. Marking the generator set
empty point on the fuel gauge will make it easier to tell when to stop the generator set before
running it out of fuel.

6.2

Fault Codes
The generator set control contains extensive diagnostics to detect shutdown faults. Following a fault
shutdown, the control indicates the fault code by flashing the numeric code on the status indicator in the
control switch.
Determine the fault code as follows:
â¢ 1 flash indicates a high engine coolant temperature.
â¢ 2 flashes indicates a low oil pressure fault (Code 2 fault).
â¢ 3 flashes indicates a service fault (Code 3 fault).
1. Press STOP/PRIME on the control switch once to have the 2-digit service fault code flash.
The 2-digit code consists of two sets of flashes. The first set is of flashes represents the 10s
digit of the code. After a brief pause, the second digit of the code flashes representing the unit
digit of the code. This is followed by a long pause before repeating the flashing of the fault
code.
For example, Fault Code 36 appears as: blink-blink-blinkâpauseâblink-blink-blink-blink-blinkblinkâlong pauseârepeat
2. Press STOP/PRIME to stop flashing the fault code.
â¢ 4 flashes indicates that cranking exceeded 30 seconds without the engine starting (Code 4 fault).
